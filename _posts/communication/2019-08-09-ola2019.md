### International Conference on Optimization and Learning
OLA 2020, Cádiz, Spain, February 17-19, 2020

Smart cities are based on the synergistic application of communication and information technologies, interconnected devices and information from sensors to improve the quality of life of their citizens.

Many real-life problems arise in modern smart cities, including those related to smart transportation systems, smart buildings, smart communications, and smart grid/energy networks. Innovative resolution approaches have been proposed in the literature in recent years, including those dealing with computational intelligence, learning, optimization, and other novel problem-solving strategies.

The Special Session on Computational Intelligence for Smart Cities aims at discussing recent advances and exploring future directions on the application of computational methods to solve a wide range of problems arising in smart cities.


The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
-   Learning and data science for smart cities
-   Computational intelligence for smart energy, energy efficiency and sustainability (environmental, social, economic)
-   Computational intelligence for logistics
-   Novel resolution approaches for infrastructure, energy and environmental problems
-   Optimization and management for smart mobility
-   Computational intelligence in smart homes and Internet of Things
-   Computational methods to improve governance and citizenship
-   Computational intelligence in smart healthcare systems
-   Computational intelligence in tourism and entertainment
-   Computational intelligence in circular economy
-   Cyberphysical systems and Internet of Things
-   Computational intelligence for security, big data, open data, and software

**SUBMISSION OF PAPERS**

Submissions in two different formats will be accepted:
-   S1: Extended abstracts of work-in-progress and position papers of a maximum of 3 pages
-   S2: Original research contributions of a maximum of 10 pages


**IMPORTANT DATES**

 - Submission deadline:  **Ocober 4, 2019**
 - Notification of acceptance:  **November 16, 2019**
  

**PROCEEDINGS**

Accepted papers in categories S1 and S2 will be published in the proceedings that will be available at the conference. In addition, a post-conference indexed Springer book will be published. Participants will be invited to submit updated versions of their work for consideration. Special issues of indexed journals are planned too.
