During June 17-18 (2019), the [Research Executive Agency (REA)](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/agencies/rea) of the European Commission
held the **Artificial intelligence a way forward for Europe** meeting. 
The main idea behind this event was providing an environment of debate in which outstanding AI European funded researchers presented their 
current work and discuss the future of AI in Europe and to point possible future directions of the new policies. 
  
We were invited to present our work regarding the application of **co-evolutionary algorithms** to address 
**efficient deep learning**, specifically, to deal with generative adversarial networks (GAN) training. 
Besides, we also presented the use of such novel approach in two real world use cases for our society: **cybersecurity** and **smart cities**.
