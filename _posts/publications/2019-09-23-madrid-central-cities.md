#### Motivation

Air pollution is the top health hazard in the European Union, as it reduces life expectancy, loss of years of healthy life, and diminishes the quality of health. 
Noise pollution is also a major environmental concern that critically impacts the quality of life of the city inhabitants. 
Accordingly, and under the risk of fines, countries are required to reduce noise and air pollutants.

Focusing on air pollution, European Union demanded to Spain the reduction of this type of pollutants (mainly nitrogen dioxide, NO2),
under the thread of the risk of important economic sanctions. 
This process is paralyzed in May 2018 thanks to the adoption of measures to reduce pollutants, such as Madrid Central.

However, this measure has been controversial, as different social and political groups consider it to be bothersome and ineffective. Thus, the elections (held on May, 26th 2019) the new government to apply a moratorium to override the measure (by not fining drivers who do not comply with the specific traffic regulations in Madrid Central).

We (Irene Lebru√°n, Phd. and me) decided to apply Data Science to analyse the real data gathered by the air quality and noise sensors in Madrid ans shared though the [Madrid Open Data Portal](https://datos.madrid.es). The temporal range of this study starts in December of 2016 and finishes in may of 2019, i.e., 30 moths groped in two periods: 24 months previous Madrid Central (Pre-MC) and six months with the car restrictions (Post-MC).     The complete work and results will presented during the [*I Ibero-American Congress of Smart Cities (ICSC-CITIES 2019)*](http://icsc-cities2019.com/EN_index.html).  



#### Results    
In this post, we present the results in terms of NO2 because is the pollutant that almost lead Spain to European Court. However, in our [*paper*](https://jamaltoutouh.github.io/downloads/lebrusan2019.pdf) we evaluate more air pollutants.

The following table reports the minimum (min), mean, and maximum (max) values of NO2 sensed during the evaluated periods. 
  
|   | Pre-MC | | - | | Post-MC | | 
| min        | mean           | max  | - | min        | mean           | max  |
| ----:|---------:| -----:|:---------:|-------------:|-------:| -----:|
| 15.00     | 46.92 | 96.00 | - | 8.00 | 39.60 | 96.00 |

The following figure shows the mean and standard deviation of the concentration of NO2 grouped by months (left side) and the boxplot that encapsulates the whole data for Pre-MC and Post-MC.

### Assessing the environmental impact of car restrictions policies: Madrid Central case
#### Abstract
With the increase of population living in urban areas, many transportation-related problems have grown very rapidly. Pollution causes many inhabitants health problems. A  major concern for the International Community is pollution, which causes many inhabitants health problems. Accordingly, and under the risk of fines, countries are required to reduce noise and air pollutants. As a way to do so, road restrictions policies are applied in urban areas. Evaluating objectively the benefits of this type of measures is important to asses their real impact. In this work, we analyze the application of Madrid Central (MC), which is a set of road traffic limitation measures applied in the downtown of Madrid (Spain), by using smart city tools. According to our results, MC significantly reduces the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration in the air and the levels of noise in Madrid, while not arising any border effect.
